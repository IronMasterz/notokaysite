    <h1><b>Who is Not Okay?</b></h1>
    <p style="font-size: 25px; float:left;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-4lLm-SD1OYKivp30OhiQ">Not Okay</a>, also known as Dallas, is, as the name implies, Not Okay. He is known by people online for making trash software and titling them as, "Useful", which is incorrect. He is clearly joking as well.
    Not Okay also was probably dropped as a baby, because he sure does act like it. Not Okay is currently making an autobiography about himself in the third person and by the time you read this he is done.
    He also says a lot of stupid stuff and there are quotes to prove it. <img src="https://notokay.netlify.com/poster.png" border="1" class="img-fluid" style="display:block; float:right; margin:10px;" alt="quote poster">
    The most Not Okay can do in code is too much. He has too much power and it should be taken away from him. He has yet to trademark the words "Not Okay" and you should let him because otherwise you will
    just be wasting money. Seriously, dont trademark Not Okay before him. He has issues and needs that trademark. He spends his time inside programming and playing Minecraft, kind of like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHaxi4GTYDpJgMSGy7AeSw">Michael Reeves</a>.</p>
